        <h2>Theory</h2>
            <a href="https://htmlacademy.ru/">Interactive Online HTML/CSS Courses</a>
            <p>On this site it is easy to follow the theory while practising in between. Your progress is recorded and you can always return to the item which you were doing last.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Step by step Inspector Keks takes you deeper into the wild, euhm, theory of html, of course. On the way to perceiving more and more knowledge, students get to have a glimpse at the pictures of our dear Inspector.</p>

            <p>The tom cat is red like me! We're colls! Ha-ha-ha.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Ok, back to serious now. Upon finishing the HTML and CSS course, at least the parts that are available for free, you are ready for the interview, where your knowledge will be checked in practice. If you've studied carefully enough, this shouldn't be a task too complex. Else, it might be a good idea to revise some parts once in a while.</p>
